> The structure matches the plan exactly (minus the `.claude/logging` dir that got created during the session, which we'll gitignore).
> 
> `★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
> The plugin structure demonstrates a layered architecture: scripts do the work, workflows document the procedures, the skill ties them together, commands provide thin entry points, and the agent offers freeform assistance. Each layer has a clear job and a clear relationship to the others. This is worth studying as a plugin design pattern — put intelligence in the skill, not the commands.
> 
> The path resolution bug we caught (needing `../../..` not `../..`) is a common trap with nested directory structures. Scripts at `skills/resources/scripts/` are 3 levels deep from the plugin root, not 2. Always test path resolution from the actual script location.

> ## Summary
> 
> Here's what was built:
> 
> **Plugin repo** at `.claude/local/resources/linuxiscool/claude-resources/`:
> 
> | Component | Files | Purpose |
> |-----------|-------|---------|
> | Plugin manifest | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Plugin identity and metadata |
> | Master skill | `skills/resources/SKILL.md` | Workflow index, context, and instructions |
> | Scripts | `scripts/*.sh` (4 files) | sync, restore, status, add operations |
> | Workflows | `workflows/*.md` (3 files) | Registry ops, git ops, Phase 2 skeleton |
> | Commands | `commands/*.md` (5 files) | Thin interfaces: sync, restore, status, add, add-org |
> | Agent | `agents/librarian.md` | General assistant that loads the full skill |
> | Phase 2 | `db/schema.sql` | SQLite schema skeleton for git history |
> 
> **Host project changes:**
> 
> | File | Change |
> |------|--------|
> | `.claude/settings.json` | Added `local-resources` marketplace + enabled plugin |
> | `.claude/local/resources/registry.yaml` | Added self-entry + `_orgs` key + updated comments |
> | `scripts/sync-registry.sh` | Replaced with 2-line wrapper to plugin |
> | `scripts/restore-resources.sh` | Replaced with 2-line wrapper to plugin |
> 
> **Verified:**
> - `sync-registry.sh` finds all 14 repos (including itself) — 14 matched, 0 missing
> - `status-all.sh` reports 14 repos: 12 clean, 2 dirty
> - `add-resource.sh` gracefully handles existing repos
> - Host wrappers correctly delegate to plugin scripts
> 
> The push to GitHub (Step 8) is left for you to do when ready — that requires creating the remote repo and pushing.

> All three paths work. The earlier failure was just a bash variable expansion issue in how I chained the test commands.
> 
> Now let me actually look at the commands and workflows with fresh eyes — are they using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` correctly for how Claude Code actually processes plugin files?
